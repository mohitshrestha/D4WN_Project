# D4WN_Project
Data for Workforce Nurturing (D4WN) is a project co-created and implemented by a multinational consortium led by Fundaci√≥n Capital (Latin America - Mozambique), UX Information Technologies (Mozambique), and Data Elevates (United States) to empower workers by sharing informal labor market insights and personal advice derived from data generated by two local digital platforms, Biscate and Com-Hector. The project is being funded by data.org, a platform for partnerships to build the field of data science for social impact. We believe that data science can help generate actionable insights for workers, data narratives for stakeholders to engage in data driven decision making for labor policies, and improve the design and development of digital platforms that can service informal workers and improve their financial outcomes.
